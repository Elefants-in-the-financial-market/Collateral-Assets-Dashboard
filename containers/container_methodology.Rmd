<h1>Methodology</h1>


<p>

The analysis builds on the [PACTA (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment)](https://www.transitionmonitor.com/) methodology developed by the 2Â° Investing Initiative (2DII) and a database of physical assets as well as forward looking production plans in eight key climate relevant sectors administered by Asset Resolution.<br/>

PACTA assesses the alignment of the technology-specific production plans of companies with decarbonization scenarios. The input data are asset-level data and for a time horizon of five years the output is an alignment measure capturing the discrepancy between company production plans and production plans set out in decarbonization scenarios.  We do this analysis for the following sectors: light-and heavy-duty vehicles, power, oil and gas production. TODO: smth about the relevance of these sectors. <br/>

The data used for the analysis is as below: <br/>
